# Te Bella

I plan on doing a random tea picker that has multiple functions. At it's base I will be able to pick a random tea (from a pool that contains them all), give you a history of teas you've liked based on your preferences set in settings, and a special tea randomizer where you can customize the search.

In V2 you will have a profile where you can save your teas that you've liked as well as see your friend's teas that they've liked on their account. It will also have a section for you to add/adjust your add ins if you are ordering a tea.

The wireframe currently has the main page and the setting will be worked out afterward.
